                <div id="content">
                    <b>“I will believe in the championship until the very end.” As Charles Leclerc left Budapest after another emotional weekend that has characterised his and his Ferrari team’s first half of the 2022 F1 campaign, the young Monegasque remained bullishly and refreshingly optimistic.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That is a remarkable character trait for a driver who has endured a relentless run of frustrations that would test anyone’s patience. The 24-year-old, fighting for the title for the first time in his still young career, delivered the kind of performances that scream world champion material in the opening three races of the season.

                    His reward was a 46-point lead (a near two-race advantage) over reigning world champion Max Verstappen. His efforts when behind the wheel were near faultless, his speed stunning, the Ferrari package he was given the best they’ve delivered in decades. Leclerc and Ferrari were genuine title contenders – and deservedly so.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “The last two years have been very difficult for the team, and now to be back at the top the expectations are high, and I’m fine with it,” he told me when we chatted on the balcony of Ferrari’s motorhome back in Spain. “Now we need to live up to these expectations.”

                    For the first three races, they did. Then the wheel-nuts loosened and they couldn’t fasten them back on.
                    
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div id="image"><img src="https://www.formula1.com/content/dam/fom-website/sutton/2022/Bahrain/Sunday/1386730504.jpg.transform/9col/image.jpg" alt="The season started perfectly for Leclerc with a win in Bahrain"></div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Aside from a brilliant win in Austria, every other race since has been filled with heartache. Leclerc uncharacteristically spun in Imola and third became sixth. Engine failures struck when leading in Spain and Azerbaijan. Bad strategy calls in Monaco and Silverstone lost him the lead. A strange tyre strategy in Hungary saw him go from leading the race to finishing sixth. And a mistake when trying to build a gap to Verstappen saw him crash out of the lead in France.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That leaves Leclerc 80 points behind Verstappen with nine Grands Prix to go (three of which his Red Bull rival could sit out and he’d still be leading). Leclerc has cut a disconsolate figure when he’s arrived in the TV pen after those painful defeats. His face gives away the disappointment that is eating away at him. When it’s a team mistake, Leclerc shields Ferrari as he’s a true team player. When it’s his own mistake, there’s no shield there – he is very critical of himself. In both scenarios, he faces up to the music.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He owned up to his error in France. He didn’t blame the wind or try to make another excuse. That’s not his style. But nor did he apologise for pushing to make a gap and searching for that extra tenth of a second because in his mind, if he isn’t doing that, he isn’t doing everything he can to win the championship and bring the title back to Ferrari for the first time in more than a decade.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “I’m relying on myself to do that even though it’s quite a challenging task," he says. "But let’s see how it goes. Obviously it’s a very optimistic goal. I don’t want to look into it any more negatively.”
