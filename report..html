        My final project, I did a website called F1STATISTICS. F1STATISTICS is a website sharing all the latest news on F1 as well as statistics on the current season. I chose to use the newspaper-like structure to share the news on the index page with columns and rows just like a newspaper and I use gird for the rest of the webpages.  
    </p>
    <p>
        There were a few things that inspired me when creating my website. Firstly reddit. I'm such a huge fan of Formula One that I browse through reddit to see the statistics of the races. However, the statistics were all just letters and numbers and were boring. I decided to make a website to showcase the data and statistics in a more visual way. Secondly, the official Formula One website. Their website was so clean and organized and I took some inspiration from them. Lastly, Vice.com. Their website is full of pictures and videos. All of them are designed and styled perfectly. With small little animations on the website, different slideshows of videos and the color contrast of the website, it was an inspiration to make a website as good as theirs.

        The way that my website is accessible is by using headings to organize my webpage. For example, the index.html, the homepage, I used headings to categorize different sections of the page. Different headings require different colors and sizes to differentiate the type of content. For example, using red for headings means that it is the kind of news it categorized under. It could be breaking, latest or trending news. Also, another way my website is accessible is using font color red when the user hovers over the links. This can help the user know that the text they hover is clickable. The last way I made my website accessible is by including proper alt text to all the images on the website. Especially the gallery page since there are lots of images. I made sure all the images have different names so that they could be described clearly to those who have visual impairment.  
    </p>

        I considered usability in my website. Firstly, I made sure that the text and fonts fit the theme and is clear for the users to see. I changed the line height as well so that the words and paragraphs are not clumped together that will cause the reading hard for the users. Secondly, I considered different background colors for my website and realized that a simple color such as white is the best contrast to black lettering. One of my webpages also has a different background color, which is black with a hint of blue. This is a perfect contrast to white lettering, and it does not make the reading hard. Lastly, the navigation for the website is simple and easy to navigate. The layout is not messy, and it follows the same structure as a newspaper. With a maximum of 3 columns, the user does not have to confuse themselves with all the different sections of the website. Especially on mobile view, where there is only one column, it will make the page much easier to navigate and will not cause any unnecessary confusion.

        Some things that I had to learn and find out myself were grid and how to use it effectively. Grid on its own was useful. However, I needed it to be more flexible to use for my website. Since grid worked in columns and rows, at first, I thought that my website would need to follow the structure of the grid strictly. When I set 3 columns, I would assume that for the rest of my page, there will only be three columns. However, once I learned about span in grid, I could freely change the number of columns and rows a section can occupy. This made designing the layout for my website so much easier. The second thing I had to learn about is Handlebars.js. Even though the Coursera videos covered the topic of Handlebars.js, I was still unsure of how to implement it. I had to look online to find a more in-depth explanation on how to use it. After reading through some resources online, I finally found out how to use Handlebars.js effectively. I treated Handlebars.js as a template in html for the data that is in the same format. Such as articles and gallery. All the articles and all the photos in gallery are in the same format so I implemented Handlebars.js to make my coding much easier and more effective. Thirdly was Apexchars.js. Apexcharts.js was the main reason why I decided to make this F1 website. Apexcharts helped turn data into visual images so that it is easier and more fun to study data. It took me awhile to understand how to use Apexcharts but after I understood how to use it just enough by reading the official website, I implemented it onto my website.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that for my website, grid worked well for me. For all my webpages, I implemented grid. Grid helped me organize my webpage into small different sections. This helped me a lot in assigning which section is for what content. This helped me a lot, especially for the statistics page. Since there were three charts and all the charts were of different sizes, I could easily split the page into small different sections. I assigned each chart to a section and to adjust the size of the charts, I just needed to adjust the size of the section. This can also be applied in the news sections with the different sizes of the articles.  
    </p>
    <p>
        As much as I am satisfied with my website, there is still some room for improvement. I would improve this by implementing more Handlebars.js on my website. Even though I have implemented Handlebars.js, there are still some parts of the website that could use Handlabrs.js. I believe that if i were to use Handlabars.js more, it would make my code so much cleaner. Also, I must improve the layout when in the mobile screen mode. The UI/UX for the small screens to me could be better and more aesthetically pleasing. To improve this, I will need to arrange the grid for small screens much more neater and style them in a way where they are not all clumped together. They must have a proper structure and not be in a mess.

        Resources that I used when creating my website were Handlebars.js library and Apexcharts.js library, which I have referenced in the code itself.
